@node Hardware needed
@section Hardware needed

The absolutely minimum hardware you need to build and run the White
Rabbit @sc{ptp} Core is a PC computer with Linux and one Simple PCIe @sc{fmc} Carrier
(@sc{spec}) - @uref{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/spec}. However, it is highly
recommended to use also the @sc{dio} @sc{fmc} card (@uref{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/fmc-dio-5chttla})
for storing calibration values and configuration in @sc{eeprom}(described later)
as well as feeding 1-PPS and 10MHz from external clock and outputting 1-PPS
aligned to WR time. To test the White Rabbit synchronization, you will also need:
@itemize
@item second @sc{spec} board with @sc{dio} @sc{fmc} or a White Rabbit Switch;
@item pair of @sc{wr}-supported @sc{sfp} transceivers (the list of supported
@sc{sfp}s can be found on our wiki page @uref{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/white-rabbit/wiki/SFP})
@item a roll of G652, single mode fiber to connect your @sc{spec}s or @sc{spec} with @sc{wr}
Switch.

@node Building the Core
@chapter Building the Core

@b{Note:} you can skip this chapter if you want to use the release binaries
available for download from @i{ohwr.org}.

@sp 1
Building the White Rabbit @sc{ptp} Core is a two step process. First you have to
synthesize the @sc{fpga} firmware (gateware) and then compile the software which
will be running on a softcore @sc{lm32} CPU instantiated inside the gateware.
Optionally, you can skip the compilation of @sc{lm32} software, since the
synthesized gateware contains default @sc{lm32} software.

To perform the steps below you will need a computer running Linux.

@c ==========================================================================
@node HDL synthesis
@section HDL synthesis

Before running the synthesis process you have to make sure that your
environment is set up correctly. You need the Xilinx ISE software with at least
free of charge WebPack license. @i{ISE} provides a set of scripts:
@i{settings32.sh}, @i{settings32.csh}, @i{settings64.sh} and @i{settings64.csh}
that configure all the system variables required by the Xilinx software.
Depending on the shell you use and whether your Linux is 32 or 64-bits you
should execute one of them before other tools are used. For 32-bit system and
BASH shell you should call:

@example
/opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS/settings32.sh
@end example

The easiest way to ensure that @i{ISE}-related variables are always set in your
shell is adding the execution of the script above to your @i{bash.rc} file. You
can check if the shell is configured correctly by verifying if @i{$XILINX}
variable contains the path to your @i{ISE} installation directory.

@b{Note:} current version of @i{hdlmake} tool developed at CERN requires
modification of @i{$XILINX} variable after @i{settings} script execution.
This (provided that the installation path for @i{ISE} is /opt/Xilinx/<version>)
should be the following:

@example
$ export XILINX=/opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS
@end example

@b{Note:} the Xilinx project file included in the @sc{wrpc} sources was created
with Xilinx ISE 14.5. It is however recommended to use the newest available
version of ISE software.

@sp 1
HDL sources for @sc{wr ptp} Core could be synthesized using Xilinx ISE without
any additional tools, but using @i{hdlmake} is more convenient. It creates a
synthesis Makefile and ISE project file based on a set of Manifest.py files
deployed among the directories inside the @i{wr-cores} repository.

First, please download the @i{hdlmake} binary from its location given in
@ref{Repositories and Releases} and make it executable. At the time this
document is written, the most recent stable version of @i{hdlmake} is 1.0:

@example
$ wget http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/2070/hdlmake-v1.0
$ chmod a+x hdlmake-v1.0
@end example

It is recommended to add the @i{hdlmake} binary location to your @i{$PATH}
environment variable to be able to call it from any directory:

@example
$ export PATH=<your_hdlmake_location>:$PATH
@end example

@b{Note:} the @i{hdlmake} usage instructions here are based on version 1.0.
If you use more recent release or a development version, please be aware that
its execution parameters may change. In that case please refer to @i{hdlmake}
documentation.

@sp 1
Having Xilinx ISE software and @i{hdlmake} in place, you can clone the main
@sc{wr ptp core} git repository and start building the @sc{fpga} bitstream.
First, please create a local copy of the @i{wr-cores} in the preferred
location in your system.

@example
$ git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores.git <your_location>/wr-cores
$ cd <your_location>/wr-cores
@end example

To build the gateware using sources of a stable release @value{tagname}, you
have to checkout the proper git tag:

@example
$ git checkout wrpc-v2.1
@end example

If you use @i{wr-cores} within another project (like @i{wr-nic}), you may need
to check out another release tag for this repository. Please refer to the
project's documentation to find out which version of this package you need to
build.

You also need to fetch other git repositories containing modules essential for
@sc{wr ptp core}. They are configured as git submodules inside the @i{wr-cores}
repository:

@example
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
@end example

The local copies of the submodules are stored to:

@example
<your_location>/wr-cores/ip_cores
@end example

@sp 1
The subdirectory which contains the main synthesis Manifest.py for @sc{spec} board
and in which you should perform the whole process is:

@example
$ cd <your_location>/wr-cores/syn/spec_1_1/wr_core_demo/
@end example

First, please call @i{hdlmake} to create synthesis Makefile for Xilinx
ISE:

@example
$ hdlmake-v1.0 --make-ise --ise-proj
@end example

After that, the actual synthesis is just the matter of executing:

@example
$ make
@end example

This takes (depending on your computer speed) about 15 minutes and should create
two files with @sc{fpga} firmware: @i{spec_top.bit} and @i{spec_top.bin}. The
former can be downloaded to @sc{fpga} with Xilinx Platform Cable using e.g.
@i{Xilinx Impact}. The latter can be used with the kernel drivers from
@i{spec-sw} repository (check example in @ref{Running and Configuring}).

@sp 1
If, on the other hand, you would like to clean-up the repository and rebuild
everything from scratch you can use the following commands:
@itemize
@item @i{$ make clean} - removes all synthesis reports and log files;
@item @i{$ make mrproper} - removes spec_top.bin and spec_top.bit files;
@end itemize

@c ==========================================================================
@node LM32 software compilation
@section LM32 software compilation

@b{Note:} By default, the release @sc{lm32} software is embedded inside the FPGA
bitstream you've downloaded from @i{ohwr.org} or synthesized in the previous
chapter. That means you don't have to do manual compilation of @sc{lm32}
software unless you want to use a development version or you've made some
changes required by your application.

@sp 1
To compile the @sc{lm32} software for White Rabbit @sc{ptp} Core you will need to
download and unpack the @sc{lm32} toolchain from the location mentioned in
@ref{Repositories and Releases}:

@example
$ wget http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/1133/lm32.tar.xz
$ tar xJf lm32.tar.xz -C <your_lm32_location>
@end example

Then you need to set the @t{CROSS_COMPILE} variable in order
to compile the software for a @sc{lm32} processor:

@example
$ export CROSS_COMPILE="<your_lm32_location>/lm32/bin/lm32-elf-"
@end example

To get the sources of @sc{wrpc} software please clone the @i{wrpc-sw} git
repository tagged with @value{tagname} tag. If you use @i{wrpc}
within another project, you may need to checkout a different tag or a specific
commit; if this applies, please refer to the documentation of the other package
to find the exact version you need to reproduce the released binaries before
you make your changes.

@smallexample
$ git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores/wrpc-sw.git <your_location>/wrpc-sw
$ cd <your_location>/wrpc-sw
$ git checkout wrpc-v2.1   # or "git checkout master"
@end smallexample

Before you can compile @i{wrpc-sw} you need to make a few configuration choices.
The package uses @i{Kconfig} as a configuration engine, so you may run one of the
following commnads (the first is text-mode, the second uses a KDE GUI
and the third uses a Gnome GUI):

@example
$ make menuconfig
$ make xconfig
$ make gconfig
@end example

Other @i{Kconfig} target applies, like @code{config}, @code{oldconfig}
and so on.  A few default known-good configurations are found in
@file{./configs} and you choose one by @i{make}ing it by name:

@example
$ make spec_defconfig
@end example

The most important configuration choice at this point in time is
whether to enable Etherbone or not. It is disabled by default in
@code{spec_defconfig} and enabled by default in
@code{etherbone_defconfig}.

After the package is configured, just run @code{make} without
parameters to build your binary file:

@example
$ make
@end example

The first time you build, the @i{Makefile} automatically downloads
the @i{git submodules} of this package, unless you already did that
by hand. The second and later build won't download anything
from the network.

The resulting binary @i{wrc.bin} can be then used with the loader from
@i{spec-sw} software package to program the @sc{lm32} inside the White Rabbit @sc{ptp}
Core (@ref{Running and Configuring}).

@c ##########################################################################
@node Running and Configuring
@chapter Running and Configuring

@c ==========================================================================
@node Downloading firmware to SPEC
@section Downloading firmware to SPEC

There is a @sc{spec} board software support(@sc{spec-sw}) project in @i{ohwr.org}.
It contains a set of Linux kernel drivers and user space tools, written by
Alessandro Rubini and Tomasz Wlostowski, that interact with a @sc{spec} board
plugged into a PCI-Express slot.

Instructions in this section are based on the release @i{2013-05} of @sc{spec-sw}
and are limited to absolute minimum required to load @sc{wrpc} @sc{fpga}
and @sc{lm32} firmware. Full manual for @sc{spec-sw} can be found at:

@example
http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/2134/spec-sw-2013-05-release.pdf
@end example

If there is a more recent version of the @sc{spec} software support, the
up-to-date documentation can always be found in @i{doc/} subdirectory of
@sc{spec-sw} git repository.

@sp 1
First, please clone the git repository of @sc{spec-sw} package and build it:

@smallexample
$ git clone git://ohwr.org/fmc-projects/spec/spec-sw.git <your_specsw_location>
$ cd <your_specsw_location>
$ git checkout spec-sw-v2013-05
$ make
@end smallexample

Then you have to copy your @i{spec_top.bin} generated in @ref{HDL synthesis} or
downloaded from @i{ohwr.org} to /lib/firmware/fmc/. changing its
name:

@b{Note:} the commands below have to be executed with superuser rights

@example
$ sudo cp <your_location>/wr-cores/syn/spec_1_1/wr_core_demo/spec_top.bin \
     /lib/firmware/fmc/spec-demo.bin
@end example

You have to download also the "golden" firmware for @sc{spec} card. It is used by
the drivers to recognize the hardware:

@example
$ wget http://www.ohwr.org/attachments/download/1756/spec-init.bin-2012-12-14
$ sudo mv spec-init.bin-2012-12-14 /lib/firmware/fmc/spec-init.bin
@end example

Now, you are ready to load necessary drivers that configure the
Spartan 6 @sc{fpga} with the given bitstream (make sure you are in
<your_specsw_location>):

@example
$ sudo insmod fmc-bus/kernel/fmc.ko
$ sudo insmod kernel/spec.ko
$ sudo insmod fmc-bus/kernel/fmc-trivial.ko gateware=fmc/spec-demo.bin
@end example

To check if the @sc{fpga} firmware file was found by the driver and correctly loaded
to @sc{fpga} the @i{dmesg} Linux command can be called. Among plenty of messages
you should be able to find something very similar to:

@smallexample
@noindent
[1639675.431979] spec 0000:0b:00.0:  probe for device 000b:0000
[1639675.431992] spec 0000:0b:00.0: PCI INT A -> GSI 16 (level, low) -> IRQ 16
[1639675.435246] spec 0000:0b:00.0: got file "fmc/spec-init.bin", 1484404 (0x16a674) bytes
[1639675.625773] spec 0000:0b:00.0: FPGA programming successful

[1639675.994111]       EEPROM has no FRU information
[1639705.910703] fmc fmc-0b00: Driver has no ID: matches all
[1639705.910731] spec 0000:0b:00.0: reprogramming with fmc/spec-demo.bin
[1639706.104417] spec 0000:0b:00.0: FPGA programming successful
@end smallexample

If everything went right up to this moment you have your board running the @sc{fpga}
bitstream with default @sc{lm32} software. If you want to load your own @i{wrc.bin}
built from @i{wrpc-sw} repository you can use the @i{spec-cl} tool. Programming
is done with the simple command below:

@example
$ sudo tools/spec-cl <your_location>/wrpc-sw/wrc.bin
@end example

@sp 1
Now you should be able to start the Virtual-UART tool (also part of the
@sc{spec-sw} package) that will be used to interact with the White Rabbit @sc{ptp}
Core Shell:

@example
$ sudo tools/spec-vuart
@end example

If you are able to see the @sc{wrpc} Shell prompt @i{wrc#} that means the Core is up
and running on your @sc{spec}. Congratulations !


@c ==========================================================================
@node Writing EEPROM and calibration
@section Writing EEPROM and calibration

You should perform few configuration steps through the @sc{wrpc} shell before
you start testing and using the firmware.

@b{Note:} the examples below describe only a subset of @sc{wrpc} Shell commands
required to make a basic configuration and calibration. A full description of
all supported commands can be found in @ref{WRPC Shell commands}.

@sp 1
Before making the configuration changes, it is good to stop the @sc{ptp} daemon.
Then, the debug messages from daemon would not show up to the console while you
will interact with the shell.

@example
wrc# ptp stop
@end example

If your @sc{spec} has any Mezzanine board plugged into the @sc{fmc} connector
(e.g. @sc{dio}, Fine Delay, @sc{tdc}...) then you can create a calibration
database inside the @sc{fmc} @sc{eeprom}. The example below presents @sc{wrpc}
Shell commands which create an empty @sc{sfp} database and add two Axcen
transceivers with deltaTx, deltaRx and alpha parameters associated with them.

@example
wrc# sfp erase
wrc# sfp add AXGE-1254-0531 180707 148323 72169888
wrc# sfp add AXGE-3454-0531 180707 148323 -73685416
@end example

To check the content of the @sc{sfp} database you can execute the @i{sfp show} shell
command.

@b{Note:} The deltaTx and deltaRx parameters above are the default ones for
@i{wrpc-2.1} release bitstream available on @i{ohwr.org} running on @sc{spec} v4 board
and calibrated to the port 1 of @sc{wr} Switch v3.3. Those values as well as the parameters for the
@sc{wr} Switch are available on the calibration wiki page
(@i{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/white-rabbit/wiki/Calibration}). However, if
you re-synthesize the firmware or want to have most accurate estimation of fixed
delays and alpha of your fiber you should read and perform the @sc{wr}
Calibration procedure (@i{http://www.ohwr.org/documents/213}).

@sp 1
The @sc{wr ptp} Core's mode of operation (GrandMaster/Master/Slave) can be set using the
@i{mode} shell command:

@example
wrc# mode gm       # for GrandMaster mode
wrc# mode master   # for Master mode
wrc# mode slave    # for Slave mode
@end example

This stops the @sc{ptp} daemon, changes the mode of operation, but does not start it
back automatically. Therefore after changing it you need to start the daemon
manually:

@example
wrc# ptp start
@end example

@b{Note:} For running in GrandMaster mode, you need to provide 1-PPS and 10MHz
signal from external source (e.g. GPS receiver or Cesium clock). Please connect
then 1-PPS signal to LEMO No.4 and 10MHz to LEMO No.5 connector of @sc{fmc}
@sc{dio} board.

@sp 1
One option is to type all those commands to initialize the @sc{wrpc} software to the
required state every time the Core starts. However, you can also write your own
init script to the @sc{eeprom} and @sc{wrpc} software will execute it each time
it starts (also when coming back from reset after programming the @sc{lm32}).
A simple script that reads @sc{sfp} parameters from the @sc{eeprom}, configures
the @sc{WR} mode to Slave and starts the @sc{ptp} daemon is presented below:

@example
wrc# init erase
wrc# init add ptp stop
wrc# init add sfp detect
wrc# init add sfp match
wrc# init add mode slave
wrc# init add calibration
wrc# init add ptp start
@end example

Almost exactly the same one can be used for running @sc{wrpc} in GrandMaster or
Master mode. The only difference would be @i{init add mode slave} vs. @i{init
add mode gm} or @i{init add mode master}.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Running the Core
@section Running the Core

Having the @sc{sfp} database, and the init script created in @ref{Writing EEPROM and
calibration} you can restart the @sc{wr ptp} Core by reprogramming the @sc{lm32} software
(with @i{spec-cl} tool) or by typing the shell command:

@example
wrc# init boot
@end example

You should see the log messages that confirm the init script
execution:

@example
(...)
WR Core: starting up...
W1: f80000036c38ee28
get_persistent_mac: Using W1 serial number
ID: cafebabe
t24p read from EEPROM: 6900 ps
Loops per jiffy: 20820
Locking PLL
executing: ptp stop
executing: sfp detect
AXGE-1254-0531  
executing: sfp match
SFP matched, dTx=180585, dRx=145855, alpha=72169888
executing: mode slave
Locking PLL
executing: calibration
Found phase transition in EEPROM: 6900ps
executing: ptp start
@end example

Now you should have the White Rabbit @sc{ptp} Core running in @sc{wr} Slave
mode. @sc{wrpc} needs to make a calibration of t24p phase transition value. It
has to be done only once for a new bitstream and is performed automatically when
@sc{wrpc} runs in Slave mode. That is why it is very important, even if
@sc{wrpc} is meant to run in Master mode, to configure it to Slave for a moment
and connect it to any @sc{wr} Master. That has to be repeated every time a new
bitstream (gateware) is deployed. Measured value is automatically stored to
EEPROM and used later in Master or GrandMaster mode.

The Shell also contains the monitoring function which you can use to check the
@sc{wr} synchronization status:

@example
wrc# gui
@end example

The information is presented in a clear, auto-refreshing screen. To exit
from this console mode press <Esc>. Full
description about information reported by gui is provided in @ref{WRPC GUI 
elements}.

@b{Note:} the @i{Synchronization status} and @i{Timing parameters} in @i{gui}
are available only in @sc{wr} Slave mode. When running as @sc{wr} Master, you
would be able to see only the current date and time, link status, Tx and Rx
packet counters, lock and calibration status.

@sp 1
@center @image{wrpc_mon, 12cm,,wrpc sync monitor}
@sp 1

If you want to store the statistics from @sc{wrpc} operation, it's probably
better to use the @i{stat cont} shell command. It reports the same information
as GUI but in a form which is easier to parse and analyze:

@example
wrc# stat cont
lnk:1 rx:416 tx:118 lock:1 sv:1 ss:'TRACK_PHASE' aux:0 sec:94197 \
nsec:793068184 mu:836241 dms:400556 dtxm:10 drxm:163610 dtxs:0 drxs:128400 \

temp: 45.6875 C
(...)
@end example

@sp 1
If you have a @sc{dio} Mezzanine board plugged to your @sc{spec}, you can check
the synchronization performance by observing the offset between 1-PPS signals
from the @sc{wr} Master and @sc{wr} Slave. White Rabbit @sc{ptp} Core generates
1-PPS signal to the LEMO connector No. 1 on @sc{dio} Mezzanine. However, please
remember to use oscilloscope cables having the same length and type (with the
same delay), or take their delay difference into account in your measurements.

registers inside @sc{wrpc}. Please remember to quit @i{spec-vuart} before reloading
the driver.

@b{I want to synthesize @sc{wrpc} but hdlmake does nothing, just quits without any
message.}

Please check if you have the Xilinx ISE-related system variables set correctly
(@i{settings32.sh} script provided by Xilinx sets them) and make sure you have
overwritten the @i{$XILINX} variable to:

@example
$ export XILINX=/opt/Xilinx/<version>/ISE_DS
@end example

or similar, if your installation folder differs from default.

@sp 1
@b{@sc{wr ptp} Core seems to work but I observe on my oscilloscope that the offset
between 1-PPS signals from @sc{wr} Master and @sc{wr} Slave is more than 1 ns.}

If you're trying to synchronize the @sc{spec} board to @sc{wr} Switch please remember to
read the document and perform the @sc{wr} Calibration to find out the values of
deltaRx and deltaTx for your firmware. Check if the oscilloscope cables you use
have the same delays (or take the delay difference into account in your
measurements).

@item @code{ptp stop} @tab stops @sc{wr ptp} daemon

@item @code{mode} @tab prints available @sc{wr ptp} modes
@item @code{mode gm|master|slave} @tab sets @sc{wrpc} to operate as Grandmaster clock (requires external 10MHz and 1-PPS reference), @sc{ptp} Master or @sc{ptp} Slave. After setting the mode @t{ptp start} must be re-issued

@item @code{calibration} @tab tries to read t2/4 phase transition value from @sc{eeprom} (in @sc{WR} Master or GrandMaster mode), or executes the t24p calibration procedure and stores its result to EEPROM (in @sc{WR} Slave mode)

@item @code{time} @tab prints current time from @sc{wrpc}
@item @code{time raw} @tab  prints current time in a raw format (seconds, nanoseconds)
@item @code{time set <sec> <nsec>} @tab sets @sc{wrpc} time
@item @code{time setsec <sec>} @tab sets only seconds part of @sc{wrpc} time (useful for setting time in GrandMaster mode, when nanoseconds counter is aligned to external 1-PPS and 10 MHz)
@item @code{time setnsec <nsec>} @tab sets only nanoseconds part of @sc{wrpc} time

@item @code{sfp detect} @tab prints the ID of currently used @sc{sfp} transceiver
@item @code{sfp erase} @tab cleans the @sc{sfp} database stored in @sc{fmc} @sc{eeprom}
@item @code{sfp add <ID> <deltaTx> <deltaRx> <alpha>} @tab stores calibration parameters for @sc{sfp} to the database in @sc{fmc} @sc{eeprom}
@item @code{sfp show} @tab prints all @sc{sfp} transceivers stored in database
@item @code{sfp match} @tab tries to get calibration parameters from database for currently used @sc{sfp} transceiver (@t{sfp detect} must be executed before @t{match})

@item @code{init erase} @tab cleans initialization script in @sc{fmc} @sc{eeprom}
@item @code{init add <cmd>} @tab adds shell command at the end of initialization script
@item @code{init show} @tab prints all commands from the script stored in @sc{eeprom}
@item @code{init boot} @tab executes the script stored in @sc{fmc} @sc{eeprom} (the same action is done automatically when @sc{wrpc} starts after resetting @sc{lm32})

@item @code{mac get} @tab prints @sc{wrpc}'s @sc{mac} address
@item @code{mac getp} @tab re-generates @sc{mac} address from 1-wire digital thermometer or @sc{eeprom}
