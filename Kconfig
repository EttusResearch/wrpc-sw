config ETHERBONE
	boolean "Compile Etherbone support in wrpc-sw"
	help
	  This allows to run LM32 code that is aware of Etherbone.
	  You need to run a gateware file that includes Etherbone support.
	  If in doubt, say No.

config CMD_CONFIG
	boolean "Include configuration in the output binary"
	help
	  This options adds the "config" command to the shell, which
	  reports the current configuration.  This adds half a kilobyte
	  to the binary size (100b for the code plus the .config file).

# This is a set of configuration options that should not be changed by

comment "wrpc-sw is tainted if you change the following options"
config DEVELOPER
	bool "Advanced configurations, only for developers"
	help
	  The following options are new features under testing, or
	  special customizations not normally useful for people not
	  directly working on this package.  Please don't use unless
	  you are a developer of wrpc-sw.

config RAMSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER
	int "Size of the RAM in the FPGA for this program"
	default 90112
	help
	  The usual configuration for wrpc-sw is 0x16000 bytes
	  (i.e. 88kB = 90112 bytes) but if your project has less or
	  more features you may want to adjust the FPGA size and
	  choose your preferred value here.

config STACKSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER
	int "Size of the stack area needed by this program"
	default 3584 if PPSI
	default 2048
	help
	  The linker complains if the code doesn't fit into RAM, but
	  we must also consider the stack, or the program will crash
	  at run time. (However, we have a detector for overflows).

config PRINT_BUFSIZE
	depends on DEVELOPER
	int "Size for the temporary output string of pp_printf"
	default 128
	help
	  This buffer is constant storage (i.e. wasted space), but it
	  also constraints the maximum lenght of text that can be written
	  in a single call to printf.

config CHECK_RESET
	depends on DEVELOPER
	bool "Print a stack trace if reset happens"
	help
	  If the CPU is following a NULL pointer, the program will
	  be restarted. If this option is activated, the main function
	  detects that it is re-executed and dumps a stack trace; it
	  then clears the stack (for next time) and restarts again.

choice
	prompt "Implementation of pp_printf"
	depends on DEVELOPER

config PRINTF_XINT
	bool "hex-and-int"
	help
	  This selects a printf that can only print decimal and hex
	  numbers, without obeying the format modifiers. %c and %s are
	  supported too, and %p is equivalent to %x.
	  See pp_printf/README for details.

config PRINTF_FULL
	bool "full"
	help
	  This selects an implementation that supports all standard
	  formats with modifiers, like "%08X" and "%.5s". It costs
	  around 2k of compiled code more than XINT.
	  See pp_printf/README for details.

config PRINTF_MINI
	bool "minimal"
	help
	  This selects a printf that prints all integers as hex,
	  without obeying the format modifiers. %c and %s are
	  supported too. See pp_printf/README for details.
	  This is not probably what you want for wrpc-sw.

config PRINTF_NONE
	bool "empty"
	help
	  This selects a printf that prints the format string
	  alone and ignores all further arguments. Minimal size,
	  but not suited for wrpc-sw. See pp_printf/README for details.

choice
	prompt "Choose your preferred ptp engine"
	depends on DEVELOPER

config PTP_NOPOSIX
	boolean "ptp-noposix"
	help
	  Select this option for the ptp-noposix engine

config PPSI
	boolean "ppsi"
	help
	  Select this option for the ppsi engine. Warning: this option is
	  work in progress, may not work or not compile at all.

endchoice

config PPSI_VERBOSITY
	depends on PPSI && DEVELOPER
	int "Default verbosity for PPSI"
	help
	  This option makes you select the verbosity of PPSI at startup:
	  0 means silent
	  1 means normal verbosity messages
	  2 means more verbose messages
	default 0
	range 0 2

config PPSI_RUNTIME_VERBOSITY
	depends on PPSI && DEVELOPER
	boolean "Enable runtime verbosity setting"
	default y
	help
	  If set, this option permits to change the verbosity of PPSI engine
	  runtime. This causes a bigger RAM occupation, so it is suggested
	  to set it only for debugging purpose.

config DETERMINISTIC_BINARY
	depends on DEVELOPER
	boolean "Build a binary that is the same every time"
	help
	  This option is used to #ifdef __DATE__ and __TIME__ strings
	  out of the compiled WRC binary. If you set it you'll get the
	  same binary bit-by-bit at each rebuild.  I am using this
	  option to hack the build procedure and use a simple "diff"
	  between the old and new output to verify I didn't introduce
	  changes.

	  If in doubt, say No.

config UART
	boolean "Use hardware uart (and/or vuart if available)"
	depends on DEVELOPER
	default y
	help
	  This option selects the serial driver, connected to either
	  the USB socket, or "vuart" (software fifo) or both, according
	  to how the gateware is built. 

config UART_SW
	depends on DEVELOPER
	default !UART
	boolean "Use software uart"
	help
	  The software uart is made up of two circular buffers. It can
	  be used either as an alternative to the harwdare UART or as
	  an addition. If the option is turned on, ppsi log messages
	  are routed to the software uart. The interactive wrpc shell
	  and diagnostics run on the hardware UART if available.

config W1
	depends on DEVELOPER
	boolean "Rewritten OneWire Code"
	help
	  This selects a rewritten code base for onewire, meant to be
	  cleaner than sockitowm, but currently less tested

config SOCKITOWM
       boolean
       default !W1

config SDB_EEPROM
	depends on DEVELOPER && W1
	boolean "Use SDB to manage EEPROM (instead of legacy code)"
	help
	  New experimental code to unify W1 and EEPROM storage

config LEGACY_EEPROM
	boolean
	default !SDB_EEPROM
